title: The Future of Dev Tools - Opera Next
---

<p>I thought I'd try something a little different today, by creating a (very) short video blog introducing Opera Next's Developer Tools, which are changing significantly from what was previously available in Opera (Dragonfly) now Opera are using the Chromium browser.</p>

<div class="video"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/69432073?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

<p>When I started making the video, I don't think I appreciated how long it would take to do, so don't expect too many video blogs. However, it would be nice to run more video blogs in the future - firstly, one on IE11 where we take a look around the new developer tools there; and then perhaps run the videos with a bit more structure with "latest developments", "questions and answers" and perhaps even a couple of interviews with the people that make these tools possible?</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts over on Twitter.</p>

<p>It's a Wrap!</p>
