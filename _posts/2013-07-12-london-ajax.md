title: London Ajax
---

<p>This week I got to present at 
<href="http://londonajax.com/">London Ajax</a>, thank you to the organisers for the opportunity and to everyone who came. <a href="http://andi.so/dtspla" target="_blank">Here are the slides from my talk</a> - they're mostly new secrets, so make sure you take a look!</p>

<p>Again I asked the audience what Dev Tools they were using as their primary development tool and the answers were (roughly) as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chrome: 70%</li>
    <li>Firebug: 25%</li>
    <li>Firefox: 1</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer: 1</li>
    <li>Opera: 0</li>
    <li>Safari: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're a Firebug fan, you may be please to hear that <a href="https://github.com/sroussey">Steven Roussey</a>, one of the contributors to Firebug, has created a massive update of Firebug secrets. So please join me in giving a big thank you to him!</p>

<p>Sorry that I haven't been posting many secrets recently. All my spare time has been spent working on something else (related to Developer Tools), that I will be able to announce at a later date. Needless to say, I myself will be back to posting secrets in the coming days.</p>

<p>Until Then!</p>
