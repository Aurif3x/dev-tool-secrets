title: London Web
---

<p>I've just back from presenting at this months'
<href="http://www.meetup.com/londonweb/events/91770942/">London Web</a>. Thank you to everyone who turned up, I hope you had as much fun as I did - from those I spoke to it seemed as though everyone got a lot out of it.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Nathan O'Hanlon, the organiser of London Web, for becoming a father today (technically, yesterday now). Obviously he couldn't make the meetup today - which made things interesting as I found myself introducing myself!</p>

<p>As I have done previously, I asked the audience (of around 50 people) what Dev Tools they were using as their primary development tool and the answers were (roughly) as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chrome: 50%</li>
    <li>Firebug: 45%</li>
    <li>Firefox: 1 person</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer: 0</li>
    <li>Opera: 0</li>
    <li>Safari: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>It's interesting to see the continued usage for Firebug despite it not receiving updates as frequently as the others. I hope the tools for Firefox, Opera and Safari are being used (even if not as primary tools) as they are all great resources. As I mention in my talks, we are not building sites for just one browser, so it is important to know the features and benefits of each.</p>

<p><a href="http://andi.so/dtsplw" target="_blank">Here are the slides for my London Web talk</a>. If you'd like me to talk at your event, <a href="http://www.andismith.com/contact" target="_blank">drop me a message</a>. I've signed up to speak at a few conferences, so I'm hoping to get to share the Dev Tools love around the world; but in the meantime I should be able to announce my next London talking appearance in the next few days so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Night London!</p>
